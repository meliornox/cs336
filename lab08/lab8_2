  i)   Composability is the ability to integrate a few different components into a cohesive user experience (https://ponyfoo.com/articles/composable-ui) Since the UI makes a unified experience out of many components, it's composable.  Composability matters because the same thing can be applied to many different situations.
  ii)  JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. 
  iii) Everything goes through CommentBox, having been created in CommentForm and saved in CommentList.
  iv)  A property is immutable because they are defined when components are created. A state can be changed because they are used to affect the rendering of components.

b.
  i)   The comment still shows up if I delete it.  If I delete the whole record the comment no longer shows.  This occurs becauce loadCommentsFromServer automatically refreshes.
  ii)  Render is called when createClass is run, and it doesn't need to be called again.
  iii) Components always get their details from the parent.
  iv)  We assume in most cases the comment will be valid.  In the case that the server rejects the new comment it will update.
